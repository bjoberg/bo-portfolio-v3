I am not afraid of getting involved outside of my immediate job to help build team spirit and fix the hard problems. I work fine alone, but I excel while collaborating with others.</p><p>Personally, I am a very active person interested in: golf, running, working out, hiking, camping, listening to music, and traveling.</p><p>When I am not working, you can probably find me at the top of a mountain taking pictures of the sunset. I am inspired by nature and I use photography as an excuse to experience and capture its beauty. Some other activities that I like to do are hiking, biking, weight lifting, camping, and cooking.</p><p>I love meeting new people and talking with them about their passions. So, please say hello and letâ€™s chat about your favorite things in life!</p>',
